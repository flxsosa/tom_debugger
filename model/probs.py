Here is a statement of {inf_agent}'s current observation. Only evaluate current observation of {inf_agent} based on the state. Do not imagine anything else. Think about {inf_agent}'s location. {inf_agent} is quite likely to observe all objects and events in {inf_agent}'s location, and is unlikely to observe states in another location. If {inf_agent} does not appear in the state, {inf_agent} can't observe anything. Note that the statement has to be precise in wording to be likely.

    If it is not clearly stated that {inf_agent} perceives it then we do not assume that {inf_agent} perceived the change of state.

    Think about the state of the world and others actions. {inf_agent}' belief can change throughout time through other's actions and what {inf_agent} can observe. It is also important to think about if {inf_agent} can observe other's actions. If {inf_agent} can observe the same then their belief will change and if not then their belief will remain constant.
